# Linux Config

These are all the apps and configurations I use on Linux, mostly so if I ever lose anything I can easily reinstall and get going again.

All external software and plugins will have at least one link to the source, likely in the `apps.md` file.

## Disclaimer

I am still learning shell, so the scripts may not be the best.
